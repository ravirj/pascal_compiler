made a simple lexer for  pascal which identifies almost all the tokens of pascal. symbol table in C is also there. test.pas tests the above.
Now, to make a parser and then using that to parse the pascal grammar and simulataneously insert tokens into the symbol table.

When parser will be ready convert printf statements in .l file to return statements.
